# Emotion-Recognition-through-Webcams
This script was designed to contribute to recognizing emotions using Python.

So, I found out you can even detect emotions through live webcams! Very cool! 

The packages from before are the same! 

    pip3 install cv2
    pip3 install deepface
    pip3 install numpy
    
That's all folks! Later for now!
